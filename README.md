If you got here you know damn right what it is.  
Please do not download this ~~cancer~~ awesome game, this is nothing near a serious project, and doesn't even follow git's rules. Sorry whoever needs to deal with it.

###How to compile


I really dunno how to do it on it's own, my experience with libGDX was literally 15 minutes.
I do it so: 
- Download libdgx from http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/
- Generate a project
- Open it with your favourite IDE (optional)
- Close the IDE and replace my files with your project's file
- Edit as you wish, compile using the IDE or your local compiler or whatever.
